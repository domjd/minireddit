# Minireddit App



## About

This is small app made in React and Redux for the Codecademy Full Stack course. I feel I fulfilled most of the requirments
and I learnt a lot on the course of making this app.

I gained a deeper understnading of React abnd how to manage state with Redux and although I still have much to learn I feel I got a good start here.
